`umbral-pre` is the Rust implementation of the [Umbral][umbral] threshold proxy re-encryption scheme.

Using `umbral-pre`, Alice (the data owner) can delegate decryption rights to Bob for any ciphertext intended to her, through a re-encryption process performed by a set of semi-trusted proxies or Ursulas.
When a threshold of these proxies participate by performing re-encryption, Bob is able to combine these independent re-encryptions and decrypt the original message using his private key.

For more information and usage examples please refer to the documentation.
